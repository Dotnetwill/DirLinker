> This version supports **drag & drop**.
> User can drag files or folders directly into "Link location" and "Link to" inputs from Explorer now.
> This increases productivity when it comes to move more than a handful of folders.


Directory Linker is an application that allows the user to quickly and easily create symbolic links for files and folders. 
Very useful for manual clearing space on SSD drives by moving huge folders onto another drive.

Features:
* Creates symbolic folder links
* Creates symbolic file links (Only on Vista or later)
* Moves or deletes a file/folder before creating a link, making it easier to create a link for a file/folder that already exists
* Supports undo, if anything goes wrong we can put it back.
* Supports dragging folders and files into UI.

Requirements:
* Win XP or later (It has been tested on Vista x86, Win7 x64 and Win8 x64)
* .NET 3.5
* Admin rights
